# Iris-Classification-Using-Decision-Tree
This project aims to classify Iris flowers into three species (Iris setosa, Iris versicolor, and Iris virginica) based on their sepal and petal measurements. The dataset used was obtained from Scikit-learn which can be accessed via https://scikit-learn.org/1.5/datasets/toy_dataset.html#wine-recognition-dataset. This dataset consist of 150 samples representing three species of Iris flowers (Iris setosa,  Iris versicolor, and Iris virginica). Each species consist of 50 samples. Each sample includes four numerical measurements:
- Sepal length (cm)
- Sepal width (cm)
- Petal length (cm)
- Petal width (cm)

To finish the project, I used Decision Tree in Python. Here's the Python code and presentation with a detailed explanation of the classification results.
